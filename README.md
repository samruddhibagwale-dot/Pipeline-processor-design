# Pipeline Processor Design

This project is created for Task-3 of the CODTECH Internship.

## Objective
To design a simple pipelined processor using Verilog.

## Pipeline Stages
- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Execute (EX)
- Write Back (WB)

## Files
- pipeline_processor.v
- pipeline_tb.v
- simulation_report.txt

## Result
The pipeline processor operates correctly across all stages.
